Gen 7 Sprite Pack for Pokemon Essentials (updated 1/19/17)

To use, add the contents of each folder to Graphics/Battlers/
Shinies and Eggs have been kept separate for easy exclusion. All files will go in the same location in a project.

An additional file is included with a script fix to position A-Exeggutor's sprite in the Pokedex and summary screens.
